/** Hetzner Cloud API # Overview This is the official documentation for the
  * Hetzner Cloud API. ## Introduction The Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS
  * and uses JSON as its data format. The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP
  * methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses. As an
  * alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use: -
  * Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli) - Our [library
  * for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go) - Our [library for
  * Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python) You can find even
  * more libraries, tools and integrations on our [Awesome List on
  * GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud). ### Open source
  * credits If you are developing an open-source project that supports or
  * intends to add support for Hetzner APIs, you may be eligible for a free
  * one-time credit of up to € 50 / $ 50 on your account. Please contact us via
  * the support page on your [Hetzner
  * Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/support) and let us know the
  * following: - The name of the project you are working on - A short
  * description of the project - Link to the project website or repo where the
  * project is hosted - Affiliation with / role in the project (e.g. project
  * maintainer) - Link to some other open-source work you have already done (if
  * you have done so) **Note:** We only consider rewards for projects that
  * provide Hetzner-specific functionality or integrations. For example, our
  * Object Storage exposes a standard S3 API without any Hetzner-specific
  * extensions. Projects that focus solely on generic S3 capabilities (e.g.,
  * general S3 clients or SDKs) are not Hetzner-specific and are therefore not
  * eligible for Hetzner Rewards. ## Getting Started To get started using the
  * API you first need an API token. Sign in into the [Hetzner
  * Console](https://console.hetzner.com/) choose a Project, go to `Security` →
  * `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy the token because
  * it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact
  * with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the
  * Project. Let’s say your new token is
  * `LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj`. You’re
  * now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all
  * Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using
  * [curl](https://curl.se/). Make sure to replace the token in the example
  * command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably
  * does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the
  * response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root
  * like `servers` inside the example response. A response can also contain a
  * `meta` object with information like [Pagination](#description/pagination).
  * **Example Request** ```shell curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj\" \\   https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers ```
  * **Example Response** ```json {   \"servers\": [],   \"meta\": {     \"pagination\": {       \"page\": 1,       \"per_page\": 25,       \"previous_page\": null,       \"next_page\": null,       \"last_page\": 1,       \"total_entries\": 0     }   } } ```
  * ## Authentication All requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be
  * authenticated via a API token. Include your secret API token in every
  * request you send to the API with the `Authorization` HTTP header. To create
  * a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner
  * Console](https://console.hetzner.com/) choose a Project, go to `Security` →
  * `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. **Example Authorization header** ```http Authorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj ```
  * ## Query Parameters The API makes use of query parameters to sort and filter
  * responses. The parameter names and values must be URI encoded according to
  * [RFC2396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2396). Query parameters
  * of type `array` can be used multiple times: **Example query parameters for
  * pagination** ``` https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/certificates?page=1&page_size=12 ```
  * **Example use of multiple values for a parameter** ``` https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/certificates?type=uploaded&type=managed ```
  * **Example use of an encoded parameter** ``` https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/certificates?label_selector=key%3Dvalue ```
  * ## Errors Errors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response
  * of the request which generated the error contains an error code, an error
  * message, and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details
  * object depends on the error code. The error response contains the following
  * keys: | Keys | Meaning | | --------- |
  * --------------------------------------------------------------------- | |
  * `code` | Short string indicating the type of error (machine-parsable) | |
  * `message` | Textual description on what has gone wrong | | `details` | An
  * object providing for details on the error (schema depends on code) |
  * **Example response** ```json {   \"error\": {     \"code\": \"invalid_input\",     \"message\": \"invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long\",     \"details\": {       \"fields\": [         {           \"name\": \"broken_field\",           \"messages\": [\"is too long\"]         }       ]     }   } } ```

  * ## Actions Actions represent asynchronous tasks within the API, targeting
  * one or more resources. Triggering changes in the API may return a `running`
  * action. An action should be waited upon, until it reaches either the
  * `success` or `error` state. Avoid polling the action's state too frequently
  * to reduce the risk of exhausting your API requests and hitting the [rate
  * limit](#description/rate-limiting). If an action fails, it will contain
  * details about the underlying error. Once the asynchronous tasks have
  * completed and the targeted resources are in a consistent state, the action
  * is marked as succeeded. In some cases, you may trigger multiple changes at
  * once, and only wait for the returned actions at a later stage. ## Labels
  * Labels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources. Valid
  * label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a
  * slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63
  * characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
  * (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and
  * alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must
  * be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not
  * longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`). Valid label
  * values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin
  * and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`),
  * underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. The
  * `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used. **Example Labels** ```json {   \"labels\": {     \"environment\": \"development\",     \"service\": \"backend\",     \"example.com/my\": \"label\",     \"just-a-key\": \"\"   } } ```
  * ## Label Selector For resources with labels, you can filter resources by
  * their labels using the label selector query language. | Expression | Meaning | |
  * -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | |
  * `k==v` / `k=v` | Value of key `k` does equal value `v` | | `k!=v` | Value of
  * key `k` does not equal value `v` | | `k` | Key `k` is present | | `!k` | Key
  * `k` is not present | | `k in (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`,
  * or `v3` | | `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor
  * `v2`, nor `v3` | | `k1==v,!k2` | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is
  * not present | ### Examples - Returns all resources that have a
  * `env=production` label and that don't have a `type=database` label:
  * `env=production,type!=database` - Returns all resources that have a
  * `env=testing` or `env=staging` label: `env in (testing,staging)` - Returns
  * all resources that don't have a `type` label: `!type` ## Pagination
  * Responses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support
  * pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters: - A
  * `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first page
  * is 1. - A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per
  * page. The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise
  * specified in the documentation. Responses contain a `Link` header with
  * pagination information. Additionally, if the response body is JSON and the
  * root object is an object, that object has a `pagination` object inside the
  * `meta` object with pagination information: **Example Pagination** ```json {     \"servers\": [...],     \"meta\": {         \"pagination\": {             \"page\": 2,             \"per_page\": 25,             \"previous_page\": 1,             \"next_page\": 3,             \"last_page\": 4,             \"total_entries\": 100         }     } } ```
  * The keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may
  * be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of
  * entries is unknown. **Example Pagination Link header** ```http Link: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel=\"prev\",       <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel=\"next\",       <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel=\"last\" ```
  * Line breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only
  * contain some of the above `rel` values. ## Rate Limiting All requests,
  * whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you
  * have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a
  * `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain
  * several headers which provide information about your current rate limit
  * status. - The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests
  * you can perform per hour. - The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the
  * number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame. - The
  * `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when
  * your rate limit will have recovered, and you will have the full number of
  * requests available again. The default limit is 3600 requests per hour and
  * per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For
  * example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining
  * requests will increase by 1 every second. ## Server Metadata Your Server can
  * discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to specific URLs. The
  * following data is available: | Data | Format | Contents | |
  * ----------------- | ------ |
  * ------------------------------------------------------------ | | hostname |
  * text | Name of the Server as set in the api | | instance-id | number | ID of
  * the server | | public-ipv4 | text | Primary public IPv4 address | |
  * private-networks | yaml | Details about the private networks the Server is
  * attached to | | availability-zone | text | Name of the availability zone
  * that Server runs in | | region | text | Network zone, e.g. eu-central |
  * **Example: Summary** ```shell $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata ``` ```yaml availability-zone: hel1-dc2 hostname: my-server instance-id: 42 public-ipv4: 1.2.3.4 region: eu-central ```
  * **Example: Hostname** ```shell $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/hostname my-server ```
  * **Example: Instance ID** ```shell $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/instance-id 42 ```
  * **Example: Public IPv4** ```shell $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/public-ipv4 1.2.3.4 ```
  * **Example: Private Networks** ```shell $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/private-networks ``` ```yaml - ip: 10.0.0.2   alias_ips: [10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4]   interface_num: 1   mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e0   network_id: 1234   network_name: nw-test1   network: 10.0.0.0/8   subnet: 10.0.0.0/24   gateway: 10.0.0.1 - ip: 192.168.0.2   alias_ips: []   interface_num: 2   mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e1   network_id: 4321   network_name: nw-test2   network: 192.168.0.0/16   subnet: 192.168.0.0/24   gateway: 192.168.0.1 ```
  * **Example: Availability Zone** ```shell $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/availability-zone hel1-dc2 ```
  * **Example: Region** ```shell $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/region eu-central ```
  * ## Sorting Some responses which return multiple items support sorting. If
  * they do support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used
  * for sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You
  * can sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending
  * `:asc` or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.
  * **Example: Sorting** ``` https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc ```
